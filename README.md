## introduction

This [project](en.subject.pdf) is intended to introduce system administration and the importance of using scripts to automate tasks. For that, I will use
the "docker" technology and use it to install a complete web server. This server will run multiples services: Wordpress, phpMyAdmin, and a SQL database.

## docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
